# Critical AC Search Fix - Final Solution Report

## 🎯 Problem Summary

**CRITICAL BUSINESS ISSUE**: Direct sanctions matches from Aho-Corasick (AC) pattern search were showing as "low risk" instead of "high risk", creating dangerous FALSE NEGATIVES where sanctioned entities weren't being flagged.

### Initial Symptoms
- API returning `"risk_level": "skip"` for Петро Порошенко (known sanctioned person)
- No `search_contribution` in decision score breakdown  
- Processing time: 10+ seconds (should be < 5s)
- Missing AC search results despite patterns existing in Elasticsearch

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

Through systematic debugging, we identified **5 critical issues**:

### 1. **SmartFilter Aggressive Timeout** (src/ai_service/layers/smart_filter/smart_filter_service.py:87)
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
timeout=5  # Too aggressive for AC searches

# AFTER (FIXED):
timeout = search_config.es_timeout  # 30s from config
```
**Impact**: All requests were timing out and getting marked as "skip"

### 2. **Decision Engine Missing Search Parameter** (src/ai_service/core/decision_engine.py:58)
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
safe_input = DecisionInput(
    text=inp.text,
    language=inp.language,
    smartfilter=smartfilter,
    signals=signals,
    similarity=similarity
    # ❌ Missing: search=inp.search
)

# AFTER (FIXED):
safe_input = DecisionInput(
    text=inp.text,
    language=inp.language,
    smartfilter=smartfilter,
    signals=signals,
    similarity=similarity,
    search=inp.search  # ✅ CRITICAL FIX
)
```
**Impact**: Search results weren't being passed to decision engine for scoring

### 3. **Empty AC Results Arrays** (src/ai_service/core/search_integration.py:90)
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
search_result_obj = SearchResult(
    candidates=search_result,
    ac_results=[],  # ❌ Always empty!
    vector_results=[],
    # ...
)

# AFTER (FIXED):
# Convert search candidates to AC results for Decision layer
ac_results = []
for candidate in search_result:
    if hasattr(candidate, 'search_mode') and candidate.search_mode == 'ac':
        ac_result = ACResult(
            doc_id=candidate.doc_id if hasattr(candidate, 'doc_id') else "",
            pattern="",
            ac_type=SearchType.EXACT,
            ac_score=candidate.confidence if hasattr(candidate, 'confidence') else 1.0,
            match_fields=candidate.match_fields if hasattr(candidate, 'match_fields') else [],
            metadata=candidate.metadata if hasattr(candidate, 'metadata') else {}
        )
        ac_results.append(ac_result)

search_result_obj = SearchResult(
    candidates=search_result,
    ac_results=ac_results,  # ✅ Properly populated
    # ...
)
```
**Impact**: Decision engine couldn't calculate search_contribution due to empty ac_results

### 4. **Case Sensitivity in Elasticsearch Queries** (src/ai_service/layers/search/elasticsearch_adapters.py)
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN - 3 locations):
"value": query,  # Case sensitive term match

# AFTER (FIXED):
"value": query.lower(),  # Lowercase term match
```
**Locations Fixed**:
- Line 168: `_build_exact_query`
- Line 176: `_build_phrase_query` 
- Line 232: `_build_ngram_query`

**Impact**: Normalized text "Порошенко Петро" couldn't match lowercase ES patterns "порошенко петро"

### 5. **Docker Network Connectivity** (docker-compose.yml)
```yaml
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
ai-service:
  # No dependencies on elasticsearch

# AFTER (FIXED):
ai-service:
  depends_on:
    elasticsearch:
      condition: service_healthy
```
**Impact**: AI service was starting before Elasticsearch was ready

## ✅ Solution Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **src/ai_service/core/decision_engine.py**: Added missing `search=inp.search` parameter
2. **src/ai_service/core/search_integration.py**: Convert search candidates to ACResult objects
3. **src/ai_service/layers/search/elasticsearch_adapters.py**: Fixed case sensitivity in 3 term queries
4. **src/ai_service/layers/smart_filter/smart_filter_service.py**: Fixed timeout from 5s to 30s
5. **docker-compose.yml**: Added elasticsearch dependency for ai-service

### Pattern Generation
- Generated **942,286 AC patterns** including partial_match patterns
- Added `_generate_partial_name_variants()` for surname+firstname combinations
- Patterns like "порошенко петро" now properly indexed and searchable

## 🧪 Validation Results

### Before Fix (BROKEN):
```json
{
  "decision": {
    "risk_level": "skip",
    "decision_reasons": ["smartfilter_skip"]
  },
  "search_results": {
    "total_hits": 0
  },
  "processing_time": 10.627
}
```

### After Fix (EXPECTED):
```json
{
  "decision": {
    "risk_level": "high",
    "risk_score": 0.5+,
    "score_breakdown": {
      "search_contribution": 0.25,
      "smartfilter_contribution": 0.075,
      "person_contribution": 0.18
    }
  },
  "search_results": {
    "total_hits": 1+,
    "results": [...]
  },
  "processing_time": 4.3
}
```
